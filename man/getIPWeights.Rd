}
\arguments{
\item{OData}{Input data object created by \code{importData} function.}

\item{intervened_TRT}{Column name in the input data with the probabilities (or indicators) of counterfactual treatment nodes being equal to 1 at each time point.
Leave the argument unspecified (\code{NULL}) when not intervening on treatment node(s).}

\item{intervened_MONITOR}{Column name in the input data with probabilities (or indicators) of counterfactual monitoring nodes being equal to 1 at each time point.
Leave the argument unspecified (\code{NULL}) when not intervening on the monitoring node(s).}

\item{useonly_t_TRT}{Use for intervening only on some subset of observation and time-specific treatment nodes.
Should be a character string with a logical expression that defines the subset of intervention observations.
For example, using \code{"TRT == 0"} will intervene only at observations with the value of \code{TRT} being equal to zero.
The expression can contain any variable name that was defined in the input dataset.
Leave as \code{NULL} when intervening on all observations/time-points.}

\item{useonly_t_MONITOR}{Same as \code{useonly_t_TRT}, but for monitoring nodes.}

\item{rule_name}{Optional name for the treatment/monitoring regimen.}

\item{stabilize}{Set to \code{TRUE} to return stabilized weights}

\description{
Evaluate the inverse probability weights for up to 3 intervention nodes: \code{CENS}, \code{TRT} and \code{MONITOR}.
This is based on the inverse of the propensity score fits for the observed likelihood (g0.C, g0.A, g0.N),
multiplied by the indicator of not being censored and the probability of each intervention in \code{intervened_TRT} and \code{intervened_MONITOR}.
Requires column name(s) that specify the counterfactual node values or the counterfactual probabilities of each node being 1 (for stochastic interventions).
The output is person-specific data with evaluated weights, \code{wts.DT}, only observation-times with non-zero weight are kept
Can be one regimen per single run of this block, which are then combined into a list of output datasets with lapply.
Alternative is to allow input with several rules/regimens, which are automatically combined into a list of output datasets.
