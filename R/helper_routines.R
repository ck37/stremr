# Helper routine to convert the data into the format data.table required by estmr() function.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (1) Convert the input long format data with the time ordering: (I(t), imp.I(t), C(t), A(t))
#     into the data format required by the estmr() function: (I(t), C(t), A(t), N(t):=1-imp.I(t+1)).
#     N(t) at time-point t is defined as the indicator of being observed (having an office visit) at time point t+1 (next timepoint after t)
#     The very first value of I(t) (at the first time-cycle) is ALWAYS ASSUMED observed/measured (hence I.imp=0 for each first subject-time observation).
# (2) Define a new covariate lastN.t(t) as part of L(t), which counts the number of time-points (cycles) since last visit at t-1:
#     * lastN.t(t) = 0 means that the person was monitored at time-point t-1.
#     * lastN.t(t) > 0 is the count of the number of cycles since last monitoring event.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The format of the input and output datasets.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The input data.frame Odata needs to be in long format.
# The format of the specified columns needs to be as follows.
# The time ordering of the input data at each t is as follows: (I, imp.I, C, A)
# The time ordering of the output data at each t is as follows: (I, C, A, N), where N(t)=1-imp.I(t+1).
# In output data.table, N(t-1)=1 indicates that the biomarker I(t) at t is observed and vice versa.
# In addition the output data.table will contain a column "lastN.t", where:
#   * lastN.t(t) = 0 means that the person was monitored at time-point t-1.
#   * lastN.t(t) > 0 is the count of the number of cycles since last monitoring event.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Arguments:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Odata - input data.table or data.frame
# ID - the name of the unique subject identifier (character, numeric or factor)
# I - the name of the numeric biomarkerÂ value which determines the dynamic treatment rule at each time point t.
# imp.I - the name of the binary indicator of missingness or imputation for I at time point t and it is used for for coding N(t-1):=1-imp.I(t).
#     When imp.I(t)=1 it means that the patient was not observed (no office visit) at time-point t and hence no biomarker was measured.
# N.name - the name of the variable which will be evaluated by this routine.
#     This new column MONITOR(t) is the indicator of being monitored (having a doctors visit) at time-point t+1 the indicator of the
#     imputation (having observed/measured biomarker) at time-point t+1

# Define the indicators of following/not-following specific dynamic treatment rules indexed by theta.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * This function takes an input data.frame or data.table Odata
#   and produces an output data.table with indicators/probabilities of following not following a specific treatment rule.
#   The resulting data.table is used internally by the estimtr() function to determine which observation is following each specific rule at each time point t.
# * Evaluates which observations were following the dynamic-decision treatment rule defined by the measured biomarker I
#   and pre-defined cutoffs of the input vector theta.
# * Produces a separate rule indicator column for each value in the input vector theta based on the following dynamic rule at t:
# (1) Follow rule at t if uncensored (C(t)=0) and remaining on treatment (A(t-1)=A(t)=1)
# (2) Follow rule at t if uncensored (C(t)=0), haven't changed treatment and wasn't monitored (MONITOR(t-1)=0)
# (3) Follow rule at t if uncensored (C(t)=0), was monitored (MONITOR(t-1)=0) and either of the two:
#     (A) (I(t) >= d.theta) and switched to treatment at t; or (B) (I(t) < d.theta) and haven't changed treatment
# * The format (time-ordering) of Odata is the same as required by the estimtr() function: (I(t), CENS(t), TRT(t), MONITOR(t)).
#   MONITOR(t) at time-point t is defined as the indicator of being observed (having an office visit) at time point t+1 (next timepoint after t)
#   It is assumed that imp.I(t) is always 0 for the very first time-point.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Arguments:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# theta - the vector of continuous cutoff values that index each dynamic treatment rule
# Odata - input data.frame in long format, see below for the description of the assumed format.
# ID - the name of the unique subject identifier
# t - the name of the variable indicating time-period
# I - continuous biomarker variable used for determining the treatmet decision rule
# CENS - binary indicator of being censored at t;
# TRT - binary indicator of the treatment (exposure) at t;
# MONITOR - The indicator of having a visit and having measured or observed biomarker I(t+1) (the biomarker value at THE NEXT TIME CYCLE).
#     In other words the value of MONITOR(t-1) (at t-1) being 1 indicates that I(t) at time point t was observed/measured.
#     The very first value of I(t) (at the first time-cycle) is ALWAYS ASSUMED observed/measured.
# rule.names - vector of column names for indicators of following/not following each rule (must be the same dimension as theta).
#   When not supplied the following convention is adopted for naming these columns: paste0("d",theta).
