Description: Inverse Probability Weighted Estimator (IPW) and 
    Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator (TMLE) for survival in longitudinal data 
    with time-varying confounding and right-censoring.
    The user-specified interventions on time-varying exposures and monitoring variables can
    be either stochastic, dynamic or static. The exposure, monitoring and censoring
    can be binary, categorical or multivariate (e.g., can use more than one column
    of dummy indicators for different censoring events or can code such censoring
    events with a single categorical censoring variable). The output produced
    includes the estimate of the survival curve, which is mapped from the estimated
    discrete hazard function. When more than one intervention on exposures/
    monitoring is specified, the package will produce several survival curves, one
    survival curve for each user-defined intervention. The input data needs to be in
    long format.
